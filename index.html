        I want to sharpen my programming skillset, especially in web development<br>

        E-Shamba is a web platform that revolutionizes mechanized agriculture.<br>

        In use. This means that the user can then earn money from his <br>
        Agricultural equipment when not in use. It also provides a means for<br>
        Farmers to communicate and receive latest Agricultural news and offers<br>
        From our website. Written in HTML, CSS and Javascript<br>
