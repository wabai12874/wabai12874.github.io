<div class="about" id="about">
    <h1 class="text3">About Me.</h1>
    <p>A graduate from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.<br>
        I am a creative in the online space. Well versed in UI Design and Mockups.<br>
        Fun and outgoing. Lover of artwork, digital drawing, design and driving.<br>
        Past work experience with EquityBank Msa Road as a Relationship Officer.<br>
        Also worked with Attain Entreprise Solutions, under Web Development.<br>
        <b style="color: black; font-weight: normal;">Why Programming at Moringa, you might ask?</b><br>
        I want to sharpen my programming skillset, especially in web development<br>
        So i can easily and efficiently transform the designs and mockups that<br>
        I design into beautiful, fully functional websites. To be honest,<br>
        Who wouldn't love to be great at programming?<br>
    </p>

<!--this last div contains past projects and their descriptions. unfortunately, the hosting service i used to host them
is currently down since it was a free platform and the webpages cannot be viewed online. however, i have the repositories
for the websites at github and those are the links that i have provided below. the href links therefore redirect the user to
the repositories of my projects but not the actual live websites since they are currently down as explained.
however, as soon as the webhost service provider is up and running, i will update the href links to quickly
redirect the user to the live webpages-->

        In use. This means that the user can then earn money from his <br>
        Agricultural equipment when not in use. It also provides a means for<br>
        Farmers to communicate and receive latest Agricultural news and offers<br>
        From our website. Written in HTML, CSS and Javascript<br>
